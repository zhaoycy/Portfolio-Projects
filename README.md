## About
Hi, I'm Lanbing, a data analyst with a background in macroeconomic analysis. <br>

After finishing a data analysis bootcapm, I became a Junior Data Analyst intern at Fortray Global Services Ltd, where I have worked with large datasets, created interactive dashboards, and supported data-driven decisions. My skills in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau have helped improve reporting accuracy and streamline analytics processes.<br>

## Data Analysis Projects
 In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### App Rating Prediction using python
**Code**:[App Rating Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/zhaoycy/Data-Analysis/blob/main/App_Rating_Prediction.ipynb)

**Goal**: To predict the ratings of mobile apps based on various features such as app size, reviews, installs, price, category, and content rating.

**Description**: The project aimed to predict the ratings of apps in the Play Store, with the objective of identifying high-potential apps that could be boosted for greater visibility. The dataset contained information about app size, reviews, installs, price, category, and content rating. The steps involved data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a regression model to predict app ratings. The model used Linear Regression to predict ratings based on various features, and its performance was evaluated using the R² score.

**Skills**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), linear regression, log transform, data visualization, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

**Results**: After cleaning and preprocessing the data (including handling missing values and removing outliers), the model achieved an R² score on the training set, indicating its ability to predict app ratings. The feature engineering steps included applying logarithmic transformations to reduce skewness and one-hot encoding categorical variables. This project provides a predictive model that can help identify apps with high potential ratings.

### Tech Start-up Employee Performance Mapping using SQL
**Code**: [Employee Performance Mapping.sql](https://github.com/zhaoycy/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Tech_Start-up_Employee_Performance_Mapping.sql)

**Goal**:To analyse employee performance data and facilitate the employee performance mapping for a Tech company, including employee ratings analysis, promotions & training recommendations, and bonus calculations.

**Description**: This project aimed to analyse employee data at Tech Satrt-up to support the HR department in decision-making regarding promotions, training, and bonus. The dataset contained employee information such as ID, role, experience years, salary, and performance ratings across different continents. Key tasks included filtering employees based on their performance ratings, calculating bonuses based on ratings and salary, and identifying employees who require training or promotion. The project also involved creating stored rocedure and index to streamline data retrieval and improve efficiency in HR processes.

**Skills**: Database management, CONCAT, JOIN, UNION, Group By, ORDER BY CASE， Window Function, Nested Query, VIEW, Stored Procedure, Stored Function, Index

**Results**: By creating optimized SQL queries, views, and stored procedures, the project provided a clear framework for evaluating employee performance based on ratings, experience, and salary. The calculated bonuses helped HR determine extra costs, and the distribution of ratings across departments assisted in identifying top performers and those needing improvement. The project also improved efficiency in retrieving employee data, making it easier for HR to process and make timely decisions for bonus, promotions and training.

### Flight Delay EDA using R
**Code**:[Flight Delay EDA.txt](https://github.com/zhaoycy/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Flight%20Delay%20EDA.txt)

**Goal**: To visualize the effect of various factors like scheduled time, carrier, destination, weather, and day of the week on flight delays, using a variety of plots.

**Description**: Flight delays are influenced by several factors such as scheduled times, weather conditions, and the carrier. This analysis seeks to explore and visualize how these factors correlate with delays, particularly focusing on understanding the number of delayed flights, how weather impacts delays, and the distribution of delays across different times, days, and carriers.

**Skills**: Lubridate library, Difftime, Aggregate, Missing values handling, Histogram plot, Barplot, Scatter plot, and Box plot.

**Results**: After thoroughly cleaning and preprocessing the data, including handling missing values and converting relevant variables, insightful visualizations were created to understand the relationships between flight delays and key factors such as scheduled time, carrier, weather, and origin/destination. 

### Sales Comparison for 2 Selected Regions using Tableau
**Dashboard**:[Regional Sales Comparison.png](https://github.com/zhaoycy/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Tableau%20Project1%20Sales%20Comparison%20Dashboard%20for%20Two%20Selected%20Regions.png)

**Goal**: To create a dashboard to visualise the sales comparison between two selected regions.

**Description**: The project aimed to build a comparative sales performance dashboard for upper management to analyze and assess the differences between two selected regions. The goal was to provide data-driven insights for targeted improvements in regional sales strategy. The dashboard was developed in Tableau and incorporated interactive Primary Region and Secondary Region parameters to allow users to dynamically select and compare any two regions from the dataset. Calculated fields were created to capture First Order Date, Total Sales, Average Sales per Order, Number of Customers, Number of Orders, and Number of Products in Sale for each region. 

**Skills**: Filters, Hierarchy, Calculated fields, and Parameters.

**Results**: The final dashboard provided a dynamic, side-by-side view of regional sales performance, with drill-down capabilities for each key metric. The use of parameters allowed flexible comparisons between any two regions without manual filtering, significantly improving the decision-making process. By visualizing sales KPIs such as first order date, average order value, and product diversity, stakeholders could identify patterns like delayed market entry or underperforming product mixes. 

### Data Professional Survey Breakdown using Power BI
**Dashboard**:[Data Professional Survey Breakdown.png](https://github.com/zhaoycy/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Data%20Professional%20Survey%20Breakdown.png)

**Goal**: .

**Description**: .

**Skills**: DAX (Calculated Columns, Calculated Measures), Card, Heat Map, Donut Chart, Stacked Bar Chart.

**Results**: .
