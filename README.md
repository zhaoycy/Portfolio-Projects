## About
Hi, I'm Lanbing! I have an analytical background in banking and recently, I have transitioned into data analysis. <br>

After finishing a data analysis bootcapm, I became a Junior Data Analyst intern at Fortray Global Services Ltd, where I have worked with large datasets, created interactive dashboards, and supported data-driven decisions. My skills in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau have helped improve reporting accuracy and streamline analytics processes.<br>

 In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### App Rating Prediction
**Code**:[App Rating Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/zhaoycy/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/App%20Rating%20Prediction.ipynb)

**Goal**: To predict the ratings of mobile apps based on various features such as app size, reviews, installs, price, category, and content rating.

**Description**: The project aimed to predict the ratings of apps in the ABC Play Store, with the objective of identifying high-potential apps that could be boosted for greater visibility. The dataset contained information about app size, reviews, installs, price, category, and content rating. The steps involved data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a regression model to predict app ratings. The model used Linear Regression to predict ratings based on various features, and its performance was evaluated using the R² score.

**Skills**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), linear regression, data visualization.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

**Results**: After cleaning and preprocessing the data (including handling missing values and removing outliers), the model achieved an R² score on the training set, indicating its ability to predict app ratings. The feature engineering steps included applying logarithmic transformations to reduce skewness and one-hot encoding categorical variables. This project provides a predictive model that can help identify apps with high potential ratings.
