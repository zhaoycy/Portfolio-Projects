## About
Hi, I'm Lanbing, a data analyst with a background in macroeconomic analysis. <br>

After finishing a data analysis bootcapm, I became a Junior Data Analyst intern at Fortray Global Services Ltd, where I have worked with large datasets, created interactive dashboards, and supported data-driven decisions. My skills in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau have helped improve reporting accuracy and streamline analytics processes.<br>

## Portfolio Projects
 In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### App Rating Prediction using python
**Code**:[App Rating Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/zhaoycy/Data-Analysis/blob/main/App_Rating_Prediction.ipynb)

**Goal**: To predict the ratings of mobile apps based on various features such as app size, reviews, installs, price, category, and content rating.

**Description**: The project aimed to predict the ratings of apps in the Play Store, with the objective of identifying high-potential apps that could be boosted for greater visibility. The dataset contained information about app size, reviews, installs, price, category, and content rating. The steps involved data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a regression model to predict app ratings. The model used Linear Regression to predict ratings based on various features, and its performance was evaluated using the R² score.

**Skills**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), linear regression, log transform, data visualization, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

**Results**: After cleaning and preprocessing the data (including handling missing values and removing outliers), the model achieved an R² score on the training set, indicating its ability to predict app ratings. The feature engineering steps included applying logarithmic transformations to reduce skewness and one-hot encoding categorical variables. This project provides a predictive model that can help identify apps with high potential ratings.

### Tech Start-up Employee Performance Mapping
**Code**: [Employee Performance Mapping](https://github.com/zhaoycy/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Tech_Start-up_Employee_Performance_Mapping.sql)

**Goal**:To analyse employee performance data and facilitate the employee performance mapping for a Tech company, including employee ratings analysis, promotions & training recommendations, and bonus calculations.

**Description**: This project aimed to analyse employee data at Tech Satrt-up to support the HR department in decision-making regarding promotions, training, and bonus. The dataset contained employee information such as ID, role, experience years, salary, and performance ratings across different continents. Key tasks included filtering employees based on their performance ratings, calculating bonuses based on ratings and salary, and identifying employees who require training or promotion. The project also involved creating stored rocedure and index to streamline data retrieval and improve efficiency in HR processes.

**Skills**: Database management, CONCAT, JOIN, UNION, Group By, ORDER BY CASE， Window Function, Nested Query, VIEW, Stored Procedure, Stored Function, Index

**Results**: By creating optimized SQL queries, views, and stored procedures, the project provided a clear framework for evaluating employee performance based on ratings, experience, and salary. The calculated bonuses helped HR determine extra costs, and the distribution of ratings across departments assisted in identifying top performers and those needing improvement. The project also improved efficiency in retrieving employee data, making it easier for HR to process and make timely decisions for bonus, promotions and training.
